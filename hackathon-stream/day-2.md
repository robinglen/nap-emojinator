## 26/01/2017 - 8:30 What to do

Ok so I think my focus for today has to be lets plot these on a graph.
I'm going build a simple webserver and plot some graphs using keen.io data vis.

Smash some slides together then try do some code clean up. 3pm is showtime, countdown begins.

## 26/01/2017 - 9:20 Dashboards

So decided to implement a super stupid web server thats going to serve a simple .html file that will contain some graphing stuff. Going to use Keen.io simple dashboard, by use I mean completely steal it.

This is a great reference if you are creating some dashboards:

## 26/01/2017 - 10:30 EMOJI!

My Mac is only running Yosemite, I don't have the bloody Emoji for a robot, this might be the tipping point and tempt to upgrade!
`ctrl+cmd+space`
Brings up the Emoji character map, where have you been granddad!

## 26/01/2017 - 11:48 The results are in

I have now run the final data collection, got all the results.

![Trends](/hackathon-stream/img/trends.png)

The breakdown can be found here.
[Results](results.md)

There is a server to get the results from keen, the server can be accessed like so:

```
$ npm start

http://localhost:8080/trendinator
```

Now I just need to type up some slides, make this more amusing than it is useful and not win a trip to New York.

I might try a code clean up after this too, just so it's not such a mess.
