## 26/01/2017 - 8:30 What to do

Ok so I think my focus for today has to be lets plot these on a graph.
I'm going build a simple webserver and plot some graphs using keen.io data vis.

Smash some slides together then try do some code clean up. 3pm is showtime, countdown begins.

## 26/01/2017 - 9:20 Dashboards

So decided to implement a super stupid web server thats going to serve a simple .html file that will contain some graphing stuff. Going to use Keen.io simple dashboard, by use I mean completely steal it.

This is a great reference if you are creating some dashboards:
